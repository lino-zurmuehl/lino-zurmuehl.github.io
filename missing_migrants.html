        <h2>IOM Missing Migrants Project</h2>
        <p>To practice my Leaflet and Shiny app skills, I started this small project with the IOM Missing Migrants dataset. 
            I obtained the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-missing-migrants-dataset/data">Kaggle</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The dataset encompasses details regarding the fatalities and disappearances of migrants globally. 
            It is meticulously compiled from diverse sources, including IOM field offices, media reports, and surveys. Updated on an annual basis, the dataset spans from 2014 to 2020. Curated by the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, this repository serves as a comprehensive database documenting missing and deceased migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I designed a Leaflet map to visually represent the dataset, showcasing the reported incidents. Additionally, the bar plot displays the number of incidents per migration route. Users have the flexibility to choose the year, month, and region of interest, with both the map and bar plot updating dynamically based on their selections. You can access the code for my Shiny app <a href="https://github.com/lino-zurmuehl/IOM_Missing_Migrants">here</a>.
