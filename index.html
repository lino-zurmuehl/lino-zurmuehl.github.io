        <p>I'm Lino, and my fascination with the power of data has been growing since my early high school days. It all began in 11th grade with a presentation on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which opened my eyes to how data shapes politics and society. This experience sparked my interest in political science and the transformative potential of data in this field.</p>
        
        <p>During my undergraduate studies, I developed expertise in statistical analysis, machine learning, and Computational Social Science. My passion led me to explore sentiment analysis in political science for my bachelor's thesis, focusing on how data can uncover new insights into public opinion. At GESIS, during my internship, I further deepened my knowledge by working with Python to build NLP/classification models, analyzing hate speech and slur usage on Twitter.</p> 
        
        <p>Now, as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, I work at the Center for Humans and Machines as an AI Behaviorist. I'm excited to continue expanding my expertise through the Master of Data Science for Public Policy program at Hertie School, where I look forward to combining my skills with a passion for creating positive societal impact.</p>
