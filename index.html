        <p>I'm Lino, and since my 11th-grade years, I've been fascinated by the role of data in shaping our world. 
            Starting with a presentation on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I've delved into political science, realizing the untapped potential of data in this field.
        </p>
        <p> As an undergrad, I've honed my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and Computational Social Science. 
            I explored the implementation sentiment analysis in political science for my bachelor thesis. 
            At my internship with GESIS I worked on NPL/classifiaction models with python and researched hate speech and slur usage on twitter.

            Currently, as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institut for Humand Development, where I am working in the Center for Humans and Machines as a AI Behaviorist.
            I'm thrilled about the opportunity to further my knowledge and skills in the Master of Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School.

        <h2>IOM Missing Migrants Project</h2>
        <p>To practice my leaflet and shinyapp skills I started this small project with the IOM Missing Migrants dataset. 
            I optained the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-missing-migrants-dataset/data">kaggel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The dataset encompasses details regarding the fatalities and disappearances of migrants globally. 
            It is meticulously compiled from diverse sources, including IOM field offices, media reports, and surveys. Updated on an annual basis, the dataset spans from 2014 to 2020. Curated by the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, this repository serves as a comprehensive database documenting missing and deceased migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I designed a Leaflet map to visually represent the dataset, showcasing the reported incidents. Additionally, the bar plot displays the number of incidents per migration route. Users have the flexibility to choose the year, month, and region of interest, with both the map and bar plot updating dynamically based on their selections.You can access the code for my Shiny app <a href="https://github.com/lino-zurmuehl/IOM_Missing_Migrants">here</a>.
